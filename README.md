### Project Description 🔥

Our idea was to bring back the good old days of the internet when it was not about how we could monetize our users the best way by completly breaching the privacy and creating problems all around the world through algorithmic conent. 

That's why we wanted to go back the good days when it was all about oppurtunities to connect with people all around the world in a simple way to share stories and understand different perspectives from different cultures.

Thefore we created chatroom, a simple place for people to communicate and shre ideas with each other. 💕
